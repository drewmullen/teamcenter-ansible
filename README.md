# teamcenter-ansible

This playbook was designed to spin up a teamcenter proto env on a vagrant box.

IT IS NOT WORKING. Since i removed all proprietary references from the group_vars and roles, it no longer works and would need to be heavily adjusted to work. 

If you are planning to CM your teamcenter env with ansible, fork and review the repo and adjust the group vars and roles to your personal env. Also, make sure you adjust the template in primary-tc for your own teamcenter silent.xml file
